They say that that div was put on the front page of www.geocities.com in 1999, at x: 300px; y: 300px;
It always rendered as fast as it could, positioned itself exactly where it was asked to, but because it had (accidentally?) been assigned a z-index of -999, none of the millions of people who frequented GeoCities back then ever noticed it or appreciated it.</description></item></channel></rss>
