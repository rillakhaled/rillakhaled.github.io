The actual AI apocalypse will concern incremental wear-and-tear on one's reputation the type that is only possible with knowledge of what we really do, what we really think In the actual AI apocalypse, my OS will update my profile photos to photos I had "deleted"; email uncharitable things I said within range of Siri to my colleagues; submit all of my first drafts to conferences and journals; post private DM conversations in very public Discord channels; all of this silently, efficiently, inhumanly.</description></item><item><title>Machine Translation</title><link>https://rillakhaled.github.io/sketch/machine-translation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2022 13:50:12 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rillakhaled.github.io/sketch/machine-translation/</guid><description>Machine Translation The vodka is good but the meat is rotten In the apocryphal machine translation story, the text "the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak" became, "the vodka is good but the meat is rotten".
