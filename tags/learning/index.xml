      <description>There always needs to be a first post, right?
This is that post.
In writing this, I feel the eery sensation of sliding back into 1997 or so: I was one of those teenage girls with a carefully curated website, lovingly crafted from frames with borders set to 0.
Before CSS.
Before WordPress.
When size 8 courier was a badass typographical choice.
When it still felt plausible that you could, if you really worked at it, meet everyone your age in your city camped out in web-based chat forums and IRC channels.</description>
