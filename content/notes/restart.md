There always needs to be a first post, right?

This is that post.

In writing this, I feel the eery sensation of sliding back into 1997 or so: I was one of *those teenage girls* with a carefully curated website, lovingly crafted from frames with borders set to 0.

Before CSS.

Before WordPress.

When size 8 courier was a badass typographical choice.

When it still felt plausible that you could, if you really worked at it, meet everyone your age in your city camped out in web-based chat forums and IRC channels.
