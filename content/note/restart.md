There always needs to be a first post, right?

This is that post.

Writing it evokes the eery sensation of sliding back into 1997.

Before CSS.

Before WordPress.

When size 8 courier was a badass typographical choice.

When complex layouts were painstakingly crafted from 0px border frames and 1px gifs.

When it still felt faintly plausible that you could, if you *really* worked at it, meet everyone in your country who happened to go online.
