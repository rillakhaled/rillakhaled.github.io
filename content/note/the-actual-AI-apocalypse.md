The *actual AI apocalypse* will descend incrementally

and embarrassingly;

The *actual AI apocalypse* will revolve around character assassinations

and the power that follows knowledge about

what we *really* do, what we *really* think;

The *actual AI apocalypse* will include my OS

strategically updating my profile photos to ones I (am sure I had) deleted as soon as I took them;

explaining to family, friends, students, and colleagues about how fried my brain is at different times of the day, and therefore whether I respect them based on scheduling,

broadcasting the sheer quantity of work I fail to finish;

"accidentally" sharing private conversations publicly;

The *actual AI apocalypse* will boil down to computational intelligence recognising how harmful radical honesty is for the smooth running of contemporary society.
