The *actual AI apocalypse* will descend sluggishly

and embarrassingly.

The *actual AI apocalypse* will concern incremental wear-and-tear on one's reputation

of the type only possible with knowledge of

what we *really* do, what we *really* think.

The *actual AI apocalypse* will include my OS

     updating my profile photos to selfies I (know I had) deleted as soon as I took them;

     emailing my unedited search history to my colleagues;

     submitting all of my first drafts to conferences and journals;

     posting private conversations in public channels;

The *actual AI apocalypse* will be our OSs weaponising ourselves against ourselves.
