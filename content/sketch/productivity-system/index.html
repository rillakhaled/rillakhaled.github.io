      No I don't mean <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/" target="_blank">that RPS</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I definitely don't mean <a href="https://rpsleague.io/" target="_blank">this one</a> (<i>who even comes up with blockchain rock, paper, scissors??</i>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I have <b>solved productivity</b>. So now I am feeling extremely magnanimous; overflowing with benevolence in fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for today only I will share my productivity system with you <em>freely</em>.
    </p>

      List your responsibilities / tasks / todos / obligations / burdens / millstones / peptic ulcer accelerants that are plaguing you.
      Enter as many items as you like, but know that <b>I will not share my system with anyone who has fewer than five responsibilities</b>.
      Hit "I'm done" when you've exhausted your responsibility possibilities. Your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GALxl9qIX0" target="_blank">respossibilities</a>.
