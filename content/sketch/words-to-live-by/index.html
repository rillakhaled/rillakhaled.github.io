        <p>
          For years now, I've had a habit of falling asleep
          on the sofa around 9:30pm.
        </p><p>
          The sleep comes on like a wave; it's closer to disappearing
          into unconsciousness.
        </p><p>
          I awake about an hour later, and
          then out of a confused impulse to
          wreak revenge on myself for falling asleep
          too early, I proceed to stay up for another hour or two.
        </p><p>
          I told my doctor about it, and her response to
          me was: "Do you know about sleep hygiene?"
        </p><p>
          I didn't. The words "sleep" and "hygiene" in
          combination only evoked images of dirty bedsheets.
        </p><p>
          The doctor's prescription for this was:
        </p>
        <span id="instructions">go to bed earlier.</span>
