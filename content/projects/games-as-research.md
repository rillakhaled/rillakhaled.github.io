[Games as Research](https://www.gamesasresearch.com/) is an ongoing project I am undertaking primarily with [Pippin Barr](http://www.pippinbarr.com) about documenting, observing, reflecting on, and learning from game design processes undertaken within an academic context.

Academic game design is a strange (low resolution) beast, falling somewhere between game studies and game HCI, but with special qualities that neither field adequately addresses, even when combined.

Our work is therefore about experimenting with and normalising design-oriented practices around game design research.

This extends to:

- documentation of game design trajectories for the purpose of recoverability
- analysis and interpretation of design research materials
- tools that support and facilitate design reasoning
