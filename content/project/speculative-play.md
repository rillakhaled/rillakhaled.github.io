What if we could make complex social and cultural questions playable? And what if we could do so through interactions with familiar digital interfaces set in alternative presents and near futures?

These questions constitute the backbone of the project, [Speculative Play](https://www.speculativeplay.com) (funded by the Quebec FRQSC), which seeks to explore the intersection between the discursive design traditions of Speculative and Critical Design on the one hand, and the pragmatic  philosophies and best practices of interaction design and playful media (PM) on the other.

Speculative Play encompasses a number of sub projects, including:

- ChaBoT (Rilla Khaled)
- NEO//QAB (Rilla Khaled + team)
- Aunties-Algorithms (Rilla Khaled + team)
- It is as if you were doing work (Pippin Barr)
- It is as if you were making love (Pippin Barr)
