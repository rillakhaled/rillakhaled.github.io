So consider the image a clock of sorts, that renders differently based on what time it is for you. Also, who knew SVGs were so fun?? --</description></item><item><title>(300, 300)</title><link>https://rillakhaled.github.io/note/ghost-div/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2022 19:58:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rillakhaled.github.io/note/ghost-div/</guid><description>A well-known urban legend amongst front-end developers is the ghost div who haunts (300, 300).
They say that that div was put on the front page of www.geocities.com in 1999, at top: 300px; left: 300px;
It always rendered as fast as it could, positioned itself exactly where it was asked to, but because it had (accidentally?) been assigned a z-index of -999, none of the millions of people who frequented GeoCities back then ever noticed it or appreciated it.</description></item><item><title>Les Couleurs</title><link>https://rillakhaled.github.io/sketch/les-couleurs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Apr 2022 21:19:27 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rillakhaled.github.io/sketch/les-couleurs/</guid><description> Les Couleurs</description></item><item><title>Remember 1996?</title><link>https://rillakhaled.github.io/sketch/remember-1996/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2022 15:22:16 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rillakhaled.github.io/sketch/remember-1996/</guid><description> Remember 1996? i remember when only 8 people in the country made a living off of web design that country was New Zealand; "view source" felt like looking at the internet's undies.</description></item><item><title>That Sinking Feeling</title><link>https://rillakhaled.github.io/sketch/that-sinking-feeling/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rillakhaled.github.io/sketch/that-sinking-feeling/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Only Two</title><link>https://rillakhaled.github.io/sketch/only-two/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Apr 2022 12:32:46 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rillakhaled.github.io/sketch/only-two/</guid><description> Fast, cheap, good. This much is true. You can't have three, but you can have two. Other (common) cases no one bothers to mention: one | none.</description></item><item><title>Games as Research</title><link>https://rillakhaled.github.io/project/games-as-research/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2022 16:02:46 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rillakhaled.github.io/project/games-as-research/</guid><description>Games as Research is a SSHRC-funded project I am undertaking with Pippin Barr, Danny Godin, and Jonathan Lessard about documenting, observing, reflecting on, and learning from game design processes undertaken within an academic context.
Academic game design is a strange (low resolution) beast, falling somewhere between game studies and game HCI, but with special qualities that neither field adequately addresses, even when combined.
Our work is therefore about experimenting with and normalising design-oriented practices around game design research.</description></item><item><title>Prototyping ChaBoT</title><link>https://rillakhaled.github.io/note/prototyping-chabot/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2022 11:28:45 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rillakhaled.github.io/note/prototyping-chabot/</guid><description>For the last year or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve sporadically wondered about whether there would be any benefit to be gained by conducting a CBT-ish (structured? informed?) conversation with a non-human agent. CBT is highly structured and its activities frequently serve as therapy homework, i.e. you can do them on your own.
Talking to an agent obviously wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have the same effect as talking to a human therapist, on the other hand, what would the effect be?</description></item><item><title>Speculative Play</title><link>https://rillakhaled.github.io/project/speculative-play/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Mar 2022 10:37:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rillakhaled.github.io/project/speculative-play/</guid><description>What if we could make complex social and cultural questions playable? And what if we could do so through interactions with familiar digital interfaces set in alternative presents and near futures?
These questions constitute the backbone of the project, Speculative Play (funded by the Quebec FRQSC), which seeks to explore the intersection between the discursive design traditions of Speculative and Critical Design on the one hand, and the pragmatic philosophies and best practices of interaction design and playful media (PM) on the other.</description></item><item><title>restart()</title><link>https://rillakhaled.github.io/note/restart/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2022 10:15:10 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://rillakhaled.github.io/note/restart/</guid><description>There always needs to be a first post, right?
This is that post.
Writing it evokes the eery sensation of sliding back into 1997.
Before CSS.
Before WordPress.
When size 8 courier was a badass typographical choice.
When complex layouts were painstakingly crafted from 0px border frames and 1px gifs.
When it still felt faintly plausible that you could, if you really worked at it, meet everyone in your country who happened to go online.</description></item></channel></rss>
