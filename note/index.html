They say that that div was put on the front page of www.geocities.com in 1999, at top: 300px; left: 300px;
It always rendered as fast as it could, positioned itself exactly where it was asked to, but because it had (accidentally?) been assigned a z-index of -999, none of the millions of people who frequented GeoCities back then ever noticed it or appreciated it.</p></div><div class=entry><h3><a class=title href=/note/prototyping-chabot/>Prototyping ChaBoT</a></h3><time datetime=2022-03-31>31 Mar 2022</time><div class=tags>tags:

This is that post.
Writing it evokes the eery sensation of sliding back into 1997.
Before CSS.
Before WordPress.
When size 8 courier was a badass typographical choice.
When complex layouts were painstakingly crafted from 0px border frames and 1px gifs.
When it still felt faintly plausible that you could, if you really worked at it, meet everyone in your country who happened to go online.</p></div></div></body></html>
